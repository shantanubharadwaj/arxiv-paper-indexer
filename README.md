## arxiv-paper-indexer

A modular system for ingesting, embedding, and indexing arXiv research papers to support semantic search and LLM-based querying.

arxiv-paper-indexer is a personal engineering project focused on building a reproducible indexing pipeline for arXiv research papers. 
The system ingests arXiv metadata and paper content, generates semantic representations using embeddings, and builds searchable indexes that support both similarity-based retrieval and LLM-assisted querying. 
The primary goal of this project is to explore real-world design tradeoffs in document ingestion, indexing, and retrieval systems.
